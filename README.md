# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-
The objective of this assignment is to assess the understanding and implementation skills regarding Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). These concepts are essential for developing secure systems, ensuring that users can be authenticated properly, assigned roles, and granted access based on those roles.

To implement a secure authentication and authorization system in Python, we will utilize Flask, a lightweight web framework, along with Flask-JWT-Extended for JSON Web Token (JWT) management. This implementation will cover user registration, login, logout, and role-based access control.
