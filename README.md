# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-
The objective of this assignment is to assess the understanding and implementation skills regarding Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). These concepts are essential for developing secure systems, ensuring that users can be authenticated properly, assigned roles, and granted access based on those roles.

In this implementation, we have created a basic authentication system with user registration, login, and role-based access control using Flask and JWT. Each user can be assigned a role, and access to resources is determined based on that role. This approach ensures that only authorized users can access specific endpoints, thereby enhancing the security of the application.

This example serves as a foundational framework for building more complex authentication and authorization systems. You can expand upon this by integrating a database for user storage, implementing password hashing for security, and adding more granular permissions as needed.
